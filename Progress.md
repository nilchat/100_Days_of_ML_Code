# Progess Tracker
## Day 0 - 25/08/2018
- Set up AWS instance using Udacity [guide](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/91cc6685-08df-4277-b53d-3a792b02420d/concepts/f6fccba8-0009-4d05-9356-fae428b6efb4). Spot instance is a cost effective alternative but data gets cleared with every connection termination.
- Few more cloud GPU options
  - [Crestle](https://www.crestle.com/) - runs on top of AWS
  - [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/)
